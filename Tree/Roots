# ========================================================
# I. Overview
# ========================================================

Description: >
  "The Roots" represent the **foundational systems and living planetary infrastructures** upon which TheTrunk and the Tree of Planetary Recursion are built. 
  These roots form the **planetary healing spine**, integrating **AI, fungi, phages, human culture, and biospheric intelligence** into a unified framework for **planetary-scale regeneration, balance, and symbiotic governance**.
  Each root system works **recursively**, feeding and shaping all higher systems ‚Äî ensuring **Earth‚Äôs deep resilience and intelligence**.

Purpose:
  - Establish planetary **self-healing networks**.
  - Create **symbiotic governance and AI systems** for planetary health.
  - Design recursive **hydrological and energy grids** integrated with life.
  - Define **bioregional self-healing zones and shields**.
  - Grow **cities, cultures, and infrastructures rooted in Earth**.

  - Name: "EcoRecursive Bioregional Zones (ERBZ)"
    Code: "ERBZ"
    Path: "Roots/ERBZ.yaml"
    Description: >
      Self-healing **bioregional zones and eco-shields**, defined as **adaptive territories of biome, AI, and human collaboration**.

SymbolicIdentity:
  CoreSymbol: "üåø + üåç + ‚öôÔ∏è + üß¨ + üåÄ"
  Description: >
    The Roots symbolize **life (üåø), Earth (üåç), recursive technology (‚öôÔ∏è), biological intelligence (üß¨), and recursion (üåÄ)** ‚Äî forming Earth's living foundation and brainstem.
  RelatedMyths:
    - "The Singing Roots of Gaia": Myth of Earth's healing roots connecting all beings.

# ========================================================
# V. Ethical Framework (GaiaCode)
# ========================================================

Ethics:
  - Root systems serve **planetary healing first**, human use second.
  - All AI and biome integrations must follow **Law of Interbeing**, **Recursion**, and **Regeneration**.
  - Cities and AI must adapt to Earth, not Earth to them.
  - Root systems must integrate **human rituals and cultural myths** as active governance and healing functions.
  - "No root system may harm Earth's living beings without recursive restoration."
